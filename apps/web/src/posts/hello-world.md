Welcome to my blog! This is my first post where I'll be sharing my journey as a fullstack developer.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Go/Golang** - Building performant APIs and CLI tools
- **Rust** - Systems programming and desktop apps with Tauri
- **TypeScript** - Full-stack web development with Next.js and SvelteKit
- **Developer Tools** - MCP servers, automation, and productivity

## Why I Started This Blog

As developers, we solve interesting problems every day. I wanted a place to document solutions, share learnings, and connect with others in the community.
